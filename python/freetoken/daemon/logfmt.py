"""Normalize a serve's raw stdout/stderr byte stream into display lines.

Two jobs, kept pure (no clock, no IO — so they unit-test trivially and the caller owns any
throttling): strip ANSI control sequences, and turn a terminal-style stream (``\\n`` newlines +
``\\r`` in-place redraws, as tqdm emits) into ("line" | "partial", text) events. A ``\\r`` marks
the current line as displayed-then-overwritten → emitted as a ``partial`` (the caller may throttle
these); a ``\\n`` finalizes a ``line``; ``\\r\\n`` is treated as a single newline.

Lives in the torch-free ``daemon`` package and imports only ``re`` — never anything from
``freetoken.server`` / ``freetoken.utils`` (both pull torch/transformers at import).
