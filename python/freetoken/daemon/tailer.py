"""Follow the serve's logfile into the LogRing (the same file the serve writes stdout+stderr to).

One tailer thread per child. It follows a file rather than a pipe so the stream is
identical whether the serve is one we spawned or one we re-adopted after a daemon restart — the
re-adopted daemon just reopens the file where the last one left off.

It must terminate: a naive ``tail -f`` never sees EOF while the file exists. So it loops on a
``stop`` Event (set by ``ServeManager._reap`` when the child exits) with short non-blocking reads,
and after ``stop`` is set it drains whatever remains and exits — no thread/fd leak per
start/stop cycle.

ANSI is stripped and tqdm ``\\r`` redraws are collapsed via ``LineAssembler``; intermediate redraw
frames are emitted at most every ``throttle_s`` as ``kind="progress"`` so a multi-minute weight
load shows live movement in the Logs view without flooding the ring."""
