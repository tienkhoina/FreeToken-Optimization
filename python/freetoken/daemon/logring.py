"""Bounded in-memory log ring + SSE fan-out for the engine's captured stdout.

Modeled on ``server/request_ring.py`` (a monotonic all-time cursor over a bounded deque, pulled
incrementally with ``?since=``), but re-implemented here rather than imported — anything under
``freetoken.server`` transitively pulls torch at import and would blow the daemon's §2 rule.

Two access paths, and they run on different threads, so everything is guarded by one internal
lock: the tailer thread ``append``s finalized log lines; SSE handlers on the event loop
``subscribe``/``unsubscribe`` push callbacks. ``append`` snapshots the subscriber set under the
lock and invokes callbacks OUTSIDE it (a callback must never call back in), so a mutating
subscriber can't corrupt the fan-out iteration."""
