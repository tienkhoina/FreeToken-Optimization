"""Reasoning-effort dialect handling.

Each checkpoint's template/encoder accepts only its own effort vocabulary and
hard-fails on the rest, while clients speak whatever dialect their provider
taught them. Named levels project onto the numeric scale vLLM and SGLang share,
and out-of-vocabulary values quantize to the nearest supported gear instead of
failing the request. The vocabulary is probed from the checkpoint's own
template, never from a static table: a parser-family registry cannot be keyed
correctly (Qwen3 and Qwen3.8 resolve to the same parser but only the latter
grades effort).
