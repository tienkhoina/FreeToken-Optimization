"""Fail-closed final-accounting barrier used by the daemon before stopping a serve.

The endpoint closes frontend admission first, lets already-admitted work drain for a bounded
period, then aborts anything still active and waits for the scheduler's terminal abort
acknowledgements.  Only after ``StatsTracker.active`` reaches zero is the cumulative snapshot
sealed.  The daemon persists that snapshot before it sends SIGTERM, so process shutdown can no
longer race the last sampled-token reply.
