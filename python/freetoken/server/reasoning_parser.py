"""Reasoning-content parsing for OpenAI-compatible responses.

Separates a model completion into ``reasoning_content`` (the ``<think>…</think>``
block) and ``content`` (everything else), running *before* the tool-call parser
just like SGLang's ``serving_chat`` does. Adapted from SGLang's
``python/sglang/srt/parser/reasoning_parser.py`` and trimmed to what FreeToken's
text-only edge models need.

DeepSeek-V4 / V3.2 inject the opening ``<think>`` at the generation prompt, so
the model output *starts inside* the reasoning block and only ever emits the
closing ``</think>`` (see ``tokenizer/tokenize.py``). When
thinking is active the caller must construct the parser with
``force_reasoning=True`` so the leading text is attributed to reasoning. The
model also sometimes skips ``</think>`` and jumps straight to the ``｜DSML｜``
tool block; ``tool_start_token`` ends reasoning at the first DSML marker and
preserves the block for the tool-call parser.

    Routes ``to=self`` segments to ``reasoning_text`` and ``to=user`` (or

    segment (``to=<tool>``, carrying an ``<atem:function_calls>`` block) is
    preserved verbatim (header included) in ``normal_text`` for the downstream
    ``MuseGlimmerDetector`` -- when the channel ends without its own terminator
    (an abutting ``<|start|>`` header or a headerless switch), a synthetic
    ``<|eom|>`` is appended so the detector always receives a delimited block.
    Segments open with ``<|start|>...`` headers or with a headerless
    ``to=X<|message|>`` switch (the model leaves a channel without ``<|eom|>``;
    vLLM's rule). The parser is initialized from the prompt it continues:
    every request that reaches it is a templated chat generation whose prompt
    ends with ``<|start|>assistant``, so ``header_open=True`` (the default)
    seeds a synthetic ``<|start|>`` and the turn's first bytes go through the
    ordinary full-header machinery -- a real ``<|message|>`` closes the header
    (a junk recipient yields the empty channel the model asked for), and a
    header that never gets its ``<|message|>`` falls to the unfinished-header
    end-of-stream rule below. This replaces a prefix-guessing "start" mode that
    kept misclassifying content shaped like a header (the same mechanism
    ``force_reasoning`` is for the ``<think>`` families, read from the prompt
    instead of re-derived). Text with no ATEM markers at all passes through as
    content.

    Streaming consumes the buffer as it emits (O(n) over the stream; the naive
    re-scan of the full buffer per chunk was quadratic and stalled the serving
    loop on this family's long default CoT). At end-of-stream, held text is
    delivered as content rather than dropped -- a whole reply that merely looks
    like a bare-header prefix, or prose stranded after a literal closer, must
    not vanish. All three methods are overridden; the base ``<think>`` machinery
