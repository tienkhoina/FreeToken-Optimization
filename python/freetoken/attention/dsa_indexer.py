"""GLM-5.2 DSA (IndexShare lightning indexer) addressing, mixed into the backend.

Same contract as ``dsv4_indexer.py``: the indexer's weights/projections stay in the
MODEL (it hands per-token q/k/weights in); this mixin owns the ADDRESSING -- scoring
against the paged index-key slab, causal top-k selection, and the map from selected
positions to physical rows. ``-1`` is a gather-only sentinel (the sparse-attention
kernel masks it, it never reaches a store), and device-side counts bound every kernel
so CUDA-graph replays track the live position, not the staged width.

Selection SEMANTICS are shared with DSV4 outright: GLM's token-granular top-k is
exactly ``dsv4_indexer.IndexerBackendMixin.indexer_select_{prefill,decode}`` at
``ratio=1, offset=0`` (a "block" of one token), so this mixin inherits them rather
than reimplementing. Scoring differs (token keys off the row snapshot, DSV4 scores
compressed blocks), so that part is GLM's own fused kernel.
