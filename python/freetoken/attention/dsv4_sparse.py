"""DeepSeek-V4-Flash sparse-attention backend.

DSV4's attention is bespoke (MLA sliding window + learned KV compression + Lightning
Indexer), so it does not share the generic paged kernels. It does follow the same backend
contract as every other model: the backend owns the per-forward KV ADDRESSING, allocates the
CUDA-graph input buffers, and stages them before a replay -- the model computes projections
and the compressor/indexer picks, and asks the backend to resolve them into pool slots.

The addressing DSV4 needs is a whole-history full-loc row per request:

* the window tier is a 128-entry ring, so a decode query's window candidates are
  ``translate(full_loc[pos - (pos - j) % win])`` for j in [0, win);
* the compressed tiers are addressed by BLOCK index, so block ``b`` lives at compressed row
  ``full_loc(b * ratio) // ratio``.

Both read positions anywhere in the request's history, so the backend keeps a per-batch
SNAPSHOT of those rows (``DSV4AttnMetadata.full_snap``) instead of letting the captured kernels
walk the live page table: the next batch's ``allocate_paged`` mutates that table while the
current graph is still replaying. This is the same shape as the generic backend's
``_point_to_capture`` (which copies its ragged ``indices`` into the captured buffer) and as
sglang's ``DSV4AttnMetadata.copy_()``, which copies ``page_table`` into the captured metadata.

The snapshot's width comes from ``init_capture_graph``'s ``max_seq_len``: the engine's live
ceiling min(model max, KV token budget), rounded up to the page table's 32-column alignment.
The decode staging grids are sized off that same width, so no static grid can address a column
the snapshot lacks, and the only columns either has beyond the scheduler's admission bound are
the <= 31 alignment ones -- permanently -1, hence masked in the kernel.
