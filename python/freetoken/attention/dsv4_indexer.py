"""Lightning-Indexer addressing and block selection, mixed into the sparse-attention backend.

The indexer scores every compressed block a query may attend and returns the ``index_topk``
best BLOCK indices; the attention layer then maps those to global compressed rows. Both the
gather (which paged row holds block ``b``) and the selection (which blocks are causally live,
and what a pick past the live count means) are addressing, so they live here -- the module
keeps ``wq_b`` / ``weights_proj`` and hands the projections in, mirroring sglang's
``C4IndexerBackendMixin.forward_c4_indexer(..., c4_indexer=self, ...)``.

The ``-1`` a selection emits for a pick past the live count is a gather-only sentinel: the
sparse-attention kernel masks it, and it never reaches a store.
