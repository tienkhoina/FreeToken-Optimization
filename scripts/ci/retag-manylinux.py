"""Retag `linux_x86_64` runtime wheels to their detected manylinux policy.

setuptools tags C-extension wheels `linux_<arch>`, which PyPI rejects at upload.
The CI build already runs inside the pytorch manylinux_2_28 container, so the
binaries meet the policy — only the tag is missing. This asks auditwheel which
policy the wheel's symbol versions actually satisfy and rewrites the tag.

Two deliberate choices:
  * `sym_policy`, not the overall policy: the extensions intentionally leave
    libtorch/libcudart as external NEEDED entries (provided by the installed
    torch), and the overall policy grades any non-whitelisted external lib as
    plain `linux`. `auditwheel repair` is equally unusable here — it would try
    to graft libtorch into the wheel. Detection approach follows vLLM's
    detect-manylinux-tag.py (Apache-2.0).
  * Detected tag, not a hard-coded one, with a ceiling: a wheel built outside
    the container (host glibc 2.3x) must fail loudly instead of shipping a tag
    that lies about its glibc floor.

`wheel tags` rewrites filename + WHEEL metadata + RECORD consistently; renaming
the file alone would leave the wheel internally inconsistent.

Requires: auditwheel==6.6.0 (the analyze_wheel_abi signature is version
specific), wheel.
